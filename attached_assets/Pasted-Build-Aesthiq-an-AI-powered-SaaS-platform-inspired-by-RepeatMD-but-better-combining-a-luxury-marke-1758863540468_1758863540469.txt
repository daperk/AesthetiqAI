Build Aesthiq, an AI-powered SaaS platform inspired by RepeatMD but better, combining a luxury marketing site and a multi-tenant clinic dashboard: design the marketing site with a premium beige/gold palette, serif headlines + clean sans body, responsive hero section (‘Luxury Beauty & Wellness Management’), nav links (Pricing, Contact, Dashboard), and CTAs (‘Start Free Trial’, ‘View Pricing’); include sections for Comprehensive Beauty Business Solution (Smart Scheduling with AI booking/reminders, Client CRM, Secure Payments/Deposits, Staff/Inventory, Marketing Automation), an interactive demo with tabs (‘Luxury Spa’, ‘Modern Clinic’, ‘Nature Retreat’, ‘Wellness Center’) showcasing Smart Booking, VIP Membership Portal, 3D Interactive Elements, Live Business Dashboard, Social Proof Engine, and Mobile-First Design, followed by a Pricing table (Starter $79, Professional $149, Business $299, Enterprise $599—14-day trial, metered SMS/storage/AI credits), FAQs (fees, onboarding under 30 min, booking/storage, HIPAA-compliant security/support), and a closing CTA (‘Get Started Today’). For the app side, implement multi-tenant architecture with Stripe Connect for plan billing/revenue share, roles (Owner/Manager/Provider/Front-Desk), per-location taxes/hours, and tip/partial payments. Core modules: CRM (client profiles, files, consents, photos), services & add-ons, staff calendars, rooms, inventory, invoicing, gift cards, referral/affiliate, bundles/upsells, and patient-financing hooks. Add an AI layer: Sales Copilot (scripts & follow-ups), Dynamic Offers (auto-size deposits/discounts), Lead-Scoring & Churn Risk (SMS/email plays), Ad/Creative Generator, AI Booking Chatbot (site/IG/WhatsApp), Auto-notes/SOAP summaries after visits, and AI A/B testing of offers. Build dashboards: Business Dashboard (MRR, bookings, LTV, retention, ROI) and Super-Admin Dashboard (tenant management, feature flags, usage limits, AI credit quotas). Ensure secure auth, audit logs, rate-limited webhooks, and extensible APIs for EHR/financing integrations. Make everything production-ready, mobile-first, test-covered, with smooth scrolling, consistent margins, and deployable in one click.
